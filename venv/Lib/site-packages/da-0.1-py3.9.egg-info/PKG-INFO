        =====
        
        Lite-weight task automatization in Python. In some cases it could be replacement
        for such tools as make or fabric. It is easyer than make, because you can write
        tasks in python. And you don't need to compile stuff like it happens when you need fabric.
        You don't even need to install any packages, just download it, and use like regular
        python script::
        
            $ wget https://bitbucket.org/ishalyapin/dapy/raw/master/da.py
            $ python da.py [taskname]
        
        For dev environment the easiest way is to use pip::
        
            $ pip install da
            $ da [taskname]
        
        Create da.task.py file in your project directory. For example you want to automatizate
        your django project dev environment installation.
        
        da.tasks.py::
        
            def install():
                """ echo this example demostrates how to download some staff from """
                run("virtualenv python")
                run("python/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt")
                run("mkdir -p static/pencil")
                github_download("https://github.com/un1t/pencil/tarball/master", "static/pencil")
        
            def runserver():
                """ Run django devserver """
                run("python/bin/python manage.py runserver 0:8000")
        
        Run your tasks::
        
            $ da install
            $ da runserver
